  <h3>Albums/Demos/etc&nbsp;</h3>
  <h4>1. Saint Doug: 91X Alternative Sample</h4>
  <p>Jewel's first officially released recording--acoustic version of Angel Needs
    a Ride released on a San Diego radio station's sampler with other local bands.
    This disc has no release date on it, but it came out in conjunction with,
    and shortly after, the 1994 May Day Festival.</p>
  <p>Jewel is already credited as being on Atlantic here. Also contains a track
    from the Rugburns first album. It's very much on the harder edge side, with
    Jewel, the Rugburns and Gregory Page being the only acoustic entries. </p>
