Hello Everybody,<br />
As usual it seems that you know things almost before we do. Your alert<br />about the Schick website allowed us to have them make some corrections to<br />that site in keeping with how we had agreed that Jewel's image and<br />announcement must be presented. So thanks for that.<br />
Let me answer some of your questions. First some back story. With<br />downloading so prevalent, revenues are drastically down for both record<br />labels and artists; this isn't news to any of you. Naturally this means no<br />one can afford to do things in the way they used to be done. For record<br />companies this results in the recording and promotion budgets being<br />drastically cut. No artist is exempt to this, so it affects us too.<br />Jewel had, as usual, a very specific creative vision for her next music.<br />The album she envisioned was an expensive one  to make, promote and tour.<br />So how to get the music made and to fans in a time when far less money is<br />available to do so? Enter Schick into the picture. When we heard from<br />Atlantic of Schick's interest in licensing a song for their Intuition<br />campaign, we thought it might be a good fit. Earlier this year, Atlantic<br />played Jewel's song Intuition for the Schick people; they loved it and<br />decided to license it for their commercial. What resulted was a unique<br />music partnership between the artist, the label and Schick that allowed<br />the music to be created and promoted in the way that Jewel wanted. As soon<br />as Jewel finishes the album she'll write you a note and give you the<br />entire story, it's a pretty interesting one.<br />
But basically for us it's pretty simple, there are a number of things that<br />we care a lot about, among them Jewel's music, Clearwater Project and Soul<br />City Cafe. Relationships like this one with Schick allow those to continue<br />in this currently difficult time in the industry. And by the way, Schick<br />made a donation to the Clearwater Project too and we are talking to them<br />about other ways that we could partner on Clearwater Project, Soul City<br />Cafe and her tour. So there might be more we can do together.<br />With the May IntuitionFest in New York, Schick is celebrating National<br />Intuition Day (yes one already existed). It's sort of a fair. There are a<br />number of authors speaking on the topic of intuition and a lot of other<br />things going on; it sounds pretty interesting actually. Schick invited<br />Jewel to sing and offered a slot to a Soul City Cafe artist also. They<br />preferred a female artist from the East Coast so we invited Rebecca Reed<br />to join Jewel. I think it will be great exposure for Rebecca; there will<br />be a lot of press going on.<br />
We're working on some other great promotional opportunities coming up for<br />Soul City Cafe artists and I'll let you know when we know more. Plus, I've<br />heard all the semi-finalists for the Soul City Cafe Music Quest and love<br />the music. I have my favorites and I can't wait to hear who yours are. The<br />June playoffs are going to be fun, Jewel is looking forward! Enough for<br />now, hope this answers your questions, love and gratitude to you all. You<br />are the reason.<br />
