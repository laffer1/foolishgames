<h1>You Were Meant For Me</h1>
<h2>Flight #364</h2>
<pre>I 

I miss you 
my teeth ache 
my bones are confused 
they'd grown so close 
my flesh cries like children 
I speak to them in hush 
it's not fair they say 
bring him back! 
beg him stay! 
it's not up to me. I try to explain 
but mind can't make heart understand </pre>
<pre>it does not whimper </pre>
<pre>its one lashed eye keeps blinking 
it insists simply with quiet disbelief </pre>
<pre>LOVE IS NOT WITHOUT YOU </pre>
<pre>II </pre>
<pre>I go back today 
back to where I must move from 
my toothbrush no longer welcome </pre>
<pre>my clothing canker sores </pre>
<pre>my altar a wound 
whose bleeding can only stop 
when there's nothing left 
to remind him of me </pre>
<pre>(I don't wanna go)</pre>
