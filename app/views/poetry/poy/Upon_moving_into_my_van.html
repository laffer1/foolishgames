<h1>Pieces of You</h1>

<h2>upon moving into my van</h2>

<pre>Joy. Pure Joy. I am
What I always wanted
to grow up and be
Things are becoming
more of a dream with
each waking day
the heavy brows of Daily Life
are becoming encrusted
with glitter
and the Shaking Finger
of consequence is
beginning to giggle
Grumpy old men
have wings
Bums sport halos
and everyday dullness
has begun to breathe
as I remember the
incredible lightness
of living</pre>
