She is               an amazing singer with a good personality. I think one of the best               songs she performed is "Foolish Games." JEWEL will always be one               of my favorite singers! KEEP SINGING~ </p>            <hr />            <p class="msg"> <span class="udl"><a href="mailto:cupid_okedeh@yahoo.com">Andri               Lesmana</a></span><br />              <span class="udl">Dec 11, 2000 20:58</span><br />              I want to know about jewel poetry book </p>            <hr />            <p class="msg"> <span class="udl"><a href="mailto:cupid_okedeh@yahoo.com">Andri               Lesmana</a></span><br />  <span class="udl">Dec 11, 2000 21:06</span><br />              I want to know about jewel poetry book </p>            <hr />            <p class="msg"> <span class="udl"><a href="mailto:bigj11934@cox-internet.com">Amy               Bretz</a></span><br />  <span class="udl">Dec 13, 2000 22:40</span><br />              I think this site is really great because I know Jewel has alot               of fans (including me!)
