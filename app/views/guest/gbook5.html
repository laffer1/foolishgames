My cousin one day said you have to hear this song and while i listened to Little Sister by Jewel my heart was full of great commpassion for the way she writes. I love her songs and her poetry, If I were ever giving to oppertunity to met Jewel that would be one of the greatest days of my life. She's a hero in my mind, to take how she feels and sing and write about it. One of the bigest reasons I love her music is because its about important things in life its not just about whos sleeping with who and whos doing drugs like the rest of the artist out there. Its great to know someone cares for the well being of todays society. Thank you Jewel for caring!</p><hr /><p class="msg"><span class="udl"><a href="mailto:paragon104@hotmail.com">Jen</a></span><br /><span class="udl"><a href="http://www.allisoncrowe.com">allisoncrowe.com</a></span><br /><span class="udl">10/10/2001 12:19:22 AM</span><br />Hi,this site is really great, I used to have another website on Jewel - Hotel Angel - bookmarked, but something's going on with it lately and I can't open it, so I found this site which is just as good!

I'm looking forward to hearing Jewel's new album which I hope isn't too different from POY and Spirit...anyway, well wait and see.Keep up the good work!(P.S.

Especially 'You were meant for me&amp;quot;. you are probably sick of that song, but i don't think it'll ever leave my #1 spot in my mind, whenever anyone asks me to play or sing a song, it comes to mind first.

Obviously David Gray, Coldplay, Dido&amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#166; I&amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#8482;m pretty sure Travis are well-known over there, right?  Tom McRae is well known here and a huge critical darling in the U.K., but I haven&amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#8482;t heard whether anyone in the U.S. is aware of him.  There&amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#8482;s a www.tommcrae.co.uk, but I haven&amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#8482;t noticed any other websites about him.

I love her duet with Ron Sexsmith ~ they sound really good together.  I got some other new CDs from artists I've been listening to for years, like Depeche Mode's latest one Exciter, and R.E.M.'s and even Dave Matthew's newest ones and Shea's turned out to be more interesting to me than the other ones, even though I was expecting to like hers the least out of the group.  I've always loved those bands, but their stuff doesn't seem as inspired as it once did.

A really (I mean reallllly) good looking girl, who happens to be, like, nineteen years old, and from Texas of all places, who works with the cats who did Lauren Hill&amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#8482;s record and sings a soulful racket that sounds like Alanis Morissette with some real fucking credibility, and does a duet with cult crooner Ron Sexsmith. Christ, I don&amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#8482;t have the slightest idea what to think, you tell me. But she does sound damn good. The opener &amp;quot;Last Time&amp;quot; is pretty snazzy and assertive, but I really prefer the get down shit like &amp;quot;Blind Situation&amp;quot; where she comes over like all smoldering and shit. Sexy as hell. Records like this make you think someone&amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#8482;s trying to pull something over on you. This Shea gal just crosses to many boundaries with too much ease, she sings with too much personality for a kid, and has way too much goddamn charisma. Oh yeah, and she makes Sexsmith finally sound like everything he&amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#8482;d been talked up as on a duet called &amp;quot;Always&amp;quot; that I&amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#8482;d have to call pretty gosh darn near brilliant. &amp;quot;Shheez man, what&amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#8482;s up with this chick?&amp;quot; you ask. &amp;quot;Sounds like she&amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#8482;s all over the place with this stuff? Is she soul? Is she hip-hop? Is she a folky? How about one of them thar Texan gals like that Lucinda Williams broad? Just what in tarnations is she?&amp;quot; I know&amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#166;I know, and I can&amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#8482;t answer that&amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#166;well, I guess that maybe I can try. She&amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#8482;s all of that stuff. This record is all over the place &amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#8220; but don&amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#8482;t let that get you all up in arms because Ms. Shea makes it all work. She&amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#8482;s kind of got that, you know, power, that charisma, and she sounds damn good. I dunno, maybe I&amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#8482;m just blinded by beauty.
