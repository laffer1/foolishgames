<h2>Chapter 5: A Night Without Armor</h2>
<p>A Night Without Armor was Jewel's first book. The book was released on May
  19, 1998. It featured poetry from many different aspects of her life. The book
  was released as a hard cover and audiocassette. The hard cover (ISBN 0-06-019198-8)
  originally sold for fifteen dollars (US). HarperCollins Publishers, Inc. published
the book. </p>
<p>  To promote the book, Jewel had a live poetry reading at the Virgin Megastore<sup>3</sup>  in New York, New York. Jewel read poetry, answered questions, and collected
  some early birthday gifts at the event from fans. <br>
  The publishing company released five poems to Jewel fan sites during that time
  to promote the book as well. The poem titles were &#8220;I Miss Your Touch&#8221;, &#8220;Insecurity&#8221;, &#8220;I
  Say to You Idols&#8221;, &#8220;It Has Been Long&#8221;, and &#8220;As a Child
  I Walked.&#8221;</p>
<p>  The book was later released as a paperback and can be picked up at local
  bookstores in that form.</p>
