<h1>Angel (aka Fly To Me Angel / Cowby Waltz)</h1>
<pre>
Oh my angel
Sweet sweet angel
Come to me swiftly
This night so still
For dawn does come swiftly
Im so far from home
Just tell me angel
Im never alone
My hands are unsteady
I been gone too long
Your face is so lovely
It keeps my faith strong
So lay with me angel
And speak not a word
Your bodys so slender
Like the wings of a bird
Fly from me angel
You see dawns a-come
Be with you angel
On the wings of a song
</pre>
