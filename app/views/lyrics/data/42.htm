<h1>Do You</h1>
<pre>
hey, you say you like the way the cowboys tip their hats and say, "how's it goin' ma'am?" 
but you're never quite clear if their glares are sincere 
or really only just second-hand

to you it's all roses 
it's a lavender haze 
the man is a marvel 
but it's a shame about his brains 
but that's ok 
you say, "he's got straight teeth and it's good sex."

you look to the sky 
you look to the man 
you claim innocence and not to understand 
or do you, do you?
there's a big man wearing a white suit 
and patent leather shoes 
he wants to take his monkeys to see the kids at the zoo 
'cause the gypsy on the corner said, "hey, mister you can't lose."

and it's your first day at the track 
you feel that heat on your back 
we all want to find a way to beat the system 
find some rhythm in the madness 
get down on your knees and pray 
say, "i'll do whatever you want, 
god, just let me have my way." 
well will you, will you?

come on all you merry men 
rally your cry 
dance with the devil for tomorrow we'll surely.... 
hey, hey blow the men down

you with all your cigarettes and cool stares 
filled with blank glares and loaded regrets 
just like the girls today with nothing to say 
no more pigtails and pony rides 
they're sophisticated 
they sip on lattes and have their eyes on a bigger prize

we shake our fists and say, 
"well good golly, we're mad 
that god kills children with our very own hands."
we claim innocence and not to understand 
or do we, do we?

come on all you merry men 
rally your cry 
dance with the devil for tomorrow we'll surely... 
hey, hey blow the men down 
blow the men down 
hey
