<h1>Fade Away (I'm Fading)</h1>
<pre>
It's K-Mart, the bathroom
I'm staring in the mirror
The green lights are bright
It makes the lines clearer
Heard the Angel go
Cigarette smoke's all that's left
I've traded in my wings for a string of pearls
And now the string is all I've left

The light bulbs burn
Some ones in the stall
Big white
Brick wall
Makes me feel small
And I take my shirt off
Looking for a glimpse of flesh
I peel back the concrete
Hope there's still some soil left

Cuz I am fading
I am fading
I am fading away
I am fading
Just like fairy tales
Hero loses faith
I am fading

The air smells like urin
Getting all
I could walk out that door
But no one really ever leaves
I take all my clothing off
Trying not to forget
Stupid things like
The color of urin
And the smell of stone when it's wet
And I am naked in the mirror
With a feather in my hand
The lady comes out of the bathroom
Screaming, "Oh, Jesus!"
Like I was a man
And I ask her
"Hey, what happens to us
When we get old and in the way?"
I guess she answered  ???
Took me away

And I am fading
I am fading
I am fading away
I am fading
Just like fairy tales
Hero's loses faith
And I do not know
Why or when
I guess that Spring is jsut a leave me ??
And I am fading
I'm fading
</pre>
