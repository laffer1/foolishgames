<h1>Violet Eyes</h1>
<pre>
Transcribed by Angela (AEmerald78@aol.com)

It's been awhile
since you've been around
I've been drifting like a gypsy
from town to town
I've been to France and Rome
(?)seemed to almost glitter domes(?)
I'd lay beneath the Spanish summer skies
But I've seen nothing so lovely
as your violet eyes

Do you recall the shores of Greece?
The turquoise seas?

I've sworn I won't forget
your exact smile or where we went
Oh I'll see you in everything
And everywhere I go
I see your violet eyes
Seasons come and seasons pass
Life can seem as fragile
as a looking glass
Oh I know there must be
something more constant than time
for a night when I sleep
I feel you near me
I see your violet eyes

If I could write a postcard to you
I know that somehow it would get through
Not sure I could express
this aching in my chest
I guess that I'll always miss you

And everywhere I go
I see your violet eyes
Seasons come and seasons pass
Life can seem as fragile as a
looking glass
Oh I know there must be
something more constant than time
for a night when I sleep
I feel you near me
I see your violet eyes

It was a year ago last Christmas
we spent in Hawaii
Laughing beneath the stars
playing in the sand
and not snow
playing in the sea

It will be a year coming this
4th of July
when for the last time
we held your hand
and you closed your violet eyes

Seasons come and seasons pass
Oh
Life can seem as fragile
Oh as fragile
as a looking glass
I know that there is something more
constant than time
for at night
when I sleep
I feel you near me
I see your eyes upon me
I see your violet eyes.
