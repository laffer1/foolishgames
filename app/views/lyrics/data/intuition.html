I&#8217;m just a simple girl
In a high-tech digital world  
I really try 2 understand 
All the powers that rule this land
 
They say Ms. J&#8217;s big butt is boss 
Kate Moss can&#8217;t find a job 
In a world of postmodern fad 
What was good now is bad 

It&#8217;s not hard 2 understand 
Just follow this simple plan 

CHORUS Follow your heart 
Your intuition 
It will lead u in the right direction 
Let go of your mind 
Your intuition 
Is easy 2 find 

Just follow your heart, baby 
U look at me but you&#8217;re not quite sure
Am I it, or could u get more? 

U learn cool from magazines 
U learned love from Charlie Sheen 
If u want me, let me know 
I promise I won&#8217;t say no

CHORUS
You&#8217;ve got somethin&#8217; that you&#8217;re wantin&#8217; 2 sell 
Sell your sin, just cash in 
You&#8217;ve got somethin&#8217; that you&#8217;re wantin&#8217; 2  tell 
&#8220;You&#8217;ll love me, wait and see&#8221; 

If u want me, don&#8217;t play games 
I promise it won&#8217;t be in vain 
CHORUS 
</pre>
