<h1>I Wonder As I Wander</h1>
<pre>
i wonder as i wander
out under the sky
how Jesus the savior
did come to die
to save lowly people
like you and like i
i wonder as i wander
out under the sky

when Jesus was born
it was in a cow's stall
with shepherds and wise men
and angels and all
the blessings of Christmas
from heaven did fall
and the weary world woke
to the savior's call
</pre>
