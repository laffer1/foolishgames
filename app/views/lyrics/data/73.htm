<h1>Dancing Barefoot</h1>
<pre>
Lyrics by Patti Smith
Jewel covered this song at some concerts


She is benediction
She is addicted to he
She is the root connection
She is connecting with me

Here I go and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me

I'm dancing barefoot
Headed for a spin
Some strange music drags me in
It makes me come up
Like some heroine

She is sublimation
She is the essence of thee
She is concentrating on
He who is chosen by she

Here I go when I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me

I'm dancing barefoot
Headed for a spin
Some strange music drags me in
It makes me come up
Like some heroine

She is recreation
She intoxicated by thee
She has the slow sensation that
He is levitating with she

Here I go when I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
'Til I lose my sense of gravity

I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music drives me on
Makes me come up
Like some heroine

Oh God, I fell for you
Oh God, I fell for you
Oh God, I fell for you
Oh God, I fell for you
