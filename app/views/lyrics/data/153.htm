<h1>The Sue Lee Song</h1>
<pre>
Sometimes I falter
beneath an endless sky
And I can't remember when,
only why

And I call out your name in the darkness
from far away

These days are so strange
(so strange)
Like a fire that has no flame
Like a vessel that's hungry
for rain

And I call out your name in the darkness
from far away

Soldiers all march and fight
Spending up their youthfulness
and skinny pride
While maidens all sleep
with their hearts all on their sleeves
Bloodied from victory

These days are so long
And still I plow my way
Through these nights so cold
And these nights so strange
When even the stars
seem to lose their way

And I call out your name in the darkness
from far away

Soldiers all march and fight
Spending up their youthfulness
and skinny pride
While maidens all sleep
with their hearts all on their sleeves
Bloodied from victory

With all my heart
I want to march to where you sleep
But you rise no more
Like the strange fruit of war
Laid down
at the victorious feet

And I call out your name
from the darkness
And I call out your name
from the darkness
so far away
</pre>
