<h1>I Dont Care</h1>
<pre>
Good-bye baby, I dont think Ill be seeing you again
Good-bye baby, well say that were still friends
Even though I know I love nobody else
And even though I know, I say to myself
That this time Im leaving and I now that were through and I dont love you
And that I just dont care

Im just so tired of being another statistic on TV
The classic case of I love him, but he just dont love me

So this time Im going to be the one to say its the end
This time Im gonna be my own best friend
And Im going to save some love, some love for myself
I'll kiss you all serious
It might help that I just dont care
I dont care

So many times, I tried to tell myself
That this love would work, if I just gave up some more love for myself
I believed if I just quite my crying, youd start your trying, leave
your lying
But I believe if I just walked away, I could say
I dont care
dont care

You were always the cool one, you stood by the backdoor
You said "you know, leaving sorta makes you look good"
But this time I swear its the best youll ever see of me

So this time Im going to be the one to say its the end
This time Im gonna be my own best friend
And Im going to save some love, some love for myself
I'll kiss you all serious
It might help that I just dont care
I dont care

So many times, I tried to tell myself
That this love would work, if I just gave up some more love for myself
I believed if I just quite my crying, youd start your trying, leave
your lying
But I believe if I just walked away, I could say
I dont care
dont care

[skat over two-line verse and refrain]

So good-bye baby, I dont think Ill be seeing you again
