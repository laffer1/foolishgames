<h1>Hotel Angel (Moon Over Austin)</h1>
<pre>
Sweet man, sweet mystery
Unveil yourself to me
Sweet soul, lie so still
Flesh cup, gonna get my fill
Let me rise and fall
With the wings of your sheets
While the moon's full over Austin
The city sleeps below
Only the moon bears witness
To my hotel angel
Through the window
Your body be a tender vine
That twists and turns just like mine
Your heart a slender thong
Built of honey, filled with song
'Til dawn steals you from me
And takes me to the next town
But tonight the moon's full over Austin
And beggars starve below
And only the moon bears witness
To my hotel angel
Through the window
There's one thing that keeps me going
It's the slow and easy knowing
You're the kind of man
Who's kind of girl could maybe give her hand
So sweet man in your sweet misery
Lie upon my temporary sea
Love's dressing, I will adorn
To my side your absence be thorn
And I'll rock you gently to sleep
Tonigh is one promise we both can keep
While the moon's full over Austin
And the city sleeps below
And only the moon bears witness
To my hotel angel
Through the window
Hotel Angel
Through the window
</pre>
