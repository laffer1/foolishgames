<h1>Sassy</h1>
<pre>
See Sassy wake up she's in love
Can't you tell by the ring on her finger
Can't you tell by her fifty dollar shoes
That she confuses love with the people she uses
But don't worry about nothing, don't worry at all
It's just a temporary conjunction
Even spring's got to fall

See Sassy wake up, a little girl
She looks so feminine, so fragile, so weak
And Papa said that she's too cute for words
So Sassy never learned how to speak

But don't worry bout nothing, don't worry at all
It's just a temporary conjunction
Even spring's got to fall

Hush you baby, don't you cry
Papa's gonna buy you some pudding pie
Hush you baby, don't distress
Papa's gonna buy you a real nice dress

As though that could mend your heart
As though it could keep it from being torn apart
As though it were your destiny
To face every man you meet on your knees

See Sassy wake up on the other side
She stares at her wedding dress and starts to cry
She's got big eyes but they don't see too clear
She says, "My god, how did I end up here?"

But don't worry about it, don't worry at all
It's just a temporary conjunction
Even spring's got to fall
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

See Sassy wake up she's in love...
See Sassy wake up she's in love...
