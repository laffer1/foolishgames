<h1>U &amp; ME = LOVE</h1>
<pre>
Walk down the street
2 a psychedelic beat
I'm a real girl
In an unreal world
Disco lights and buff bodies are nice
I'm like any girl; I enjoy the sights
But I'm no Cinderella 2 your storybook fella
I'm no Barbie doll for your fantasies and all
If u let me be me, I'll be better than your best dream
U and m-e spells l-o-v-e 2 me

CHORUS

Come on, baby, won't u crash into me?
I'm like nothing that you've ever seen
Dynamite,
I'll blow your mind
Guaranteed 2 mesmerize
You'll say, "Ooh la, la, la"

Old Spice is nice
But sweat is better
E-mail is cool
But romance lives in a letter
Batteries are fine, but I'm
Energized all the time
U and m-e spells l-o-v-e 2 me

CHORUS
</pre>
