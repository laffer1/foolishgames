<h1>I Thought I Saw You Last Night</h1>
<pre>
I'm not easily scared by things that go bump in the night
Theres not many things that give me a fright
I can walk down a lonely block
And not alot can make my old knees knock

But theres one thing that scares me the most
Its when I think I see a ghost
And I thought I saw you last night

Ive been lately thinking about oujia board
And maybe contacting souls seated by the lord
Cause all the shadows on my street
Bring the sounds of shuffeling feet

But theres one thing that scares me the most
Its when I think I see a ghost
And I thought I saw you last night

Threw salt over my shoulder
I knocked on wood
Dont step on cracks
But it does no good
I drink bourbon to calm my nerves
Read an old book and chant some verse
Hold hot coals in the middle of my fists
Take advice from my exorcist
Hallelujah hail mary
Holy moly this is scary

For instance last night I went to a scary movie
And I tried real hard not to let it get to me
But I just kept looking over my shoulder
The wind got hands and I got colder

But theres one thing that scares me the most
Its when I think I see a ghost
And I thought I saw you last night
I'm not easily scared by things that go bump in the night
