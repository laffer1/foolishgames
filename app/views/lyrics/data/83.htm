<h1>Flower</h1>
<pre>
She dreams of the country
Her eyes go far away
She wishes for flowers
He says, "Perhaps in May"

The city always was gray
The reflections of his eyes
And she knows he liked it that way
And that way he shall die, well

She's always known
There was something more
There's this hunger in her belly
Like an instinct
It tells her that there's something more

This living shouldn't be called living
Cuz it's really only half a life
She's a flower that grows despite cement walls
And she will survive, she will survive

She's a rare breed with violet eyes
And leafy limbs
In conversations she looks for cracks
To dig her roots deep in

And her ways come up like daisies
She pushes her head to the sun
She says "I am content here to grow
Despite the steel frost that consumes everyone"

She's always known
There was something more
There's this hunger in her belly
Like an instinct
It tells her that there's something more

This living shouldn't be called living
Cuz it's really only half a life
She's a flower that grows despite cement walls
And she will survive, she will survive

In the end these steel cages will consume us
And like coffins ignorance will take us in and
Fashion don't mean anything
Cuz fashion cannot be our friends

And when all else fades away
And the city falls into its sleep
We'll still have flesh, blood, bones and our soul to deal with
So we should dig our roots deep

Always known
There was something more
There's this hunger in our belly
Like an instinct
It tells us that there's something more

This living shouldn't be called living
Cuz it's really only half a life
She's a flower that grows despite cement walls
And we will survive
We will survive
We will survive
We will survive
