<h1>Break Me</h1>
<pre>
I will meet you in some place
Where the light lends itself to soft repose
I will let you undress me
But I warn you I have thorns like any rose
And you could hurt me with your bare hands
You could hurt me with with the
sharp end of what you say
But I'm lost to you now &amp; theres no amount of reason
That could save me

So break me
Take me
Just let me feel your arms again
Break me
I'll let you make me
Just let me feel your love again

Feels like being underwater
Now that I've let go &amp; lost control
Water kisses fill my mouth
Water fills my soul

So break me
Take me
Just let me feel your arms again
Break me
Make me
Just let me feel your love again

Kiss me once or maybe twice
Oh, it never felt so nice
So break me
Take me
Let me feel your arms again
Break me
Make me
Just let me feel your arms again
Just let me feel your love again
</pre>
