<h1>America</h1>
<pre>
Walkin' 2 the corner of Main Street, USA
Look at the good people, hear what they gotta say-uh-huh
All right
See a sexy girl with her long black hair
See a preacher man sporting Abercrombie wear-uh-huh
All right
Walk into a corner store
A man says, "This is what I'm fighting for"

CHORUS

We are living in America
We're giving in America
We're tripping in America

Everywhere I go, seems like Bush is on TV
We shed blood in the name of liberty-uh-huh
All right
The circus tents are dead, but the sideshow is doing well
The Osbournes and Anna Nicole are too freaky 2 tell-uh-huh
All right

Take the bad with the good
I wanna change it, but I wouldn't leave it if I could

We are trying in America
We're spying in America
Getting high in America
We are laughing in America
We're crying in America
We're dying in America

We are trucking in America
We are f**king in America
We are lucky in America
We are breaking ground in America
Just another town in America
We are breaking down in America

Take the bad with the good
I wanna change it, but I wouldn't leave it if I could

CHORUS

We are trying in America
We're spying in America
We're getting high in America

We are getting tan in America
We love Spam in America
Polanski's banned from America

10 million served in America
Have u heard in America?
We're crying in America
We're laughing in America
We're living in America
