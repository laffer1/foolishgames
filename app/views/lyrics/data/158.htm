<h1>V-12 Cadillac</h1>
<pre>
He's lonely and he cruises real low
That's my V-12 Cadillac
You know he's on the go
On down to the ocean
Surfboard by my side
He's my V-12 Cadillac
With delux power glide
I check the ocean, yeah

From atop of the hill
We're going surfing
In my Coup de Ville
I pull out on the freeway
I put my Caddy in low
Then this real cute guy passed me
But my horn just wouldn't blow
So I pulled up beside him
Looked over real cool
Then he rolled down his window and he said,
"Hey baby, your Caddy's a Jewel."
I check the ocean, yeah

From atop of the hill
We're going surfing
In my Coup de Ville
He's lonely and cruises real low
That's my V-12 Cadillac
You know he's on the go
On down to the ocean
And my surfboard's by my side
It's my V-12 Cadillac
With delux power glide
I check the ocean

From the hill
We're going surfing
In my Coup de Ville
(Come on baby)
"Hey nice board, you surf?"
"Gimme a four foot wall and a good shoulder."
"Are you any good?"
"Oh honey, you don't know how good."
We're going surfing
In my Coup de Ville
(Come on)
