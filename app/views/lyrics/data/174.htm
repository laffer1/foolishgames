<h1>The New Wild West</h1>
<pre>
You see the ghosts of the buffalo
Moving both fierce and slow
Like glittering prophecies
On the edge of the horizon
As you drive glittering highways 
And beaten up bi-ways
That straddle and girdle
Our great and many faced nation
There are lambs in the ghettos
That worship their Gepettos
Believing in though never seeing
the strings they think bind them
So you write to our congressmen
With bleeding pens
Of the sorrow within
And pretend that you sent tickets to the latest Tom Hanks show
Welcome to the new Wild West
Each man for himself
A nation of civilized steeples
And lonely people
Welcome to the new Wild West
There are so many factions
And cue card reactions
It's hard to keep clear the possiblities here
Cuz there's no force to unite them
Priviledge has ruled for thousands of years
Wars has been fought with bibles and tears
Yet liberation can't deny the temptation
Soon becomes the opressor
Show me a leader
Who's fit to lead
Who don't sow his seed in anything ????
Cuz' after all what fun's power if you can act like a rock star?
Welcome to the new Wild West
Each man for himself
A nation of civilized steeples
And lonely people
Welcome to the new
Wild West
So me I've been cruel, petty, and unkind
But I know my own mind
And since it seems clear
There's no one leading us here
The only thing left it appears
Is to task ourselves to be better each time than those before us
We'll be an army of theives
Of self freed slaves
Of mild manned maids
Well fight with whispers and blades 
So get ready 
A new day is dawning 
So welcome to the new Wild West
Each man for himself
A nation of civilized steeples
And lonely people
Welcome to the New 
Welcome to the New Wild West
