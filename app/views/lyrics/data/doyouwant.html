 <h1>Do You Want To Play? (this way version)</h1>

<pre>Met her on a Friday afternoon
In a neon dayglo pink chiffon satin room
She never looks back
She always looked good dressed in black

CHORUS
Oh...You're so special
Oh...Who gives a...
Do you want to play?

She lived beneath the disco discount store
With pictures of Randy Newman scattered all across the floor
I said, "This is place looks sort of desolate"
She said, "Are you only half alive or have you always been this inarticulate?"

CHORUS

Don't think too hard
Don't think too fast
Don't ever give away what you can't take back
Don't try and understand what you can't comprehend
Underneath the disco neon daylight chandelier disco deity of the chivalry
I said, "Take it back
Take it back
Take it back"

CHORUS
</pre>
