<h1>Satellite</h1>
<pre>
Babies on beach blankets headed for Mars
Cute guys in crew cuts with the day glow surf boards
There's a pretty lady in a bikini
Her eyes are clear
But her teeth look like smashed out window panes
She's trying to fix her dreams
With seaweed and sushi and carrot juice and wheat germ

There's a wide wall
That she can't see over now
But that's ok
Because mistakes are allowed when you're a
Satellite

A jog in the morning with some vitamins
Then go to a singles bar
California is sure lovely
It's the home of the stars
And everybody's got a great body, but mine
That's just fine
Cuz everybody's so shriveled up inside
They're trying to hide behind
Power Bars and Vollyball and Valium

It's a wide wall
That we can't see over now
But that's ok
We're still growing
You know that
Mistakes are allowed when you're a
Satellite

No matter where you go
You can't outrun a cold
No matter what you do
You can't escape the flu
No matter how you try
You can't stop a satellite

In Hollywood there's all these heroes
They're strung out on grace
Half-skinned gypsies
They're crying to leave this place
There are souls stuck in a bone machine
They are dying in crowded rooms
They are dying of blood on bone
They are crushed by ???
Cigarettes and ?? and high hopes

There's a wide wall
That we can't see over now
But that's all right
We're still growing
You know that
Mistakes are allowed when you're a
Satellite

You can't hold back a
Satellite
Satellite

Babies on beach blankets headed for Mars
