<h1>Be Still My Little Heart</h1>
<pre>
Gray sky
No one's out there
To help me find
My way home

And half a jar
Of salsa
Is in my fridge
It's been there weeks

But I'm afraid if I wish tonight
My lucky star will be out of sight
It's only when the moon is high
I start to miss you standing by
Oh, be still, my little heart

A thousand things
Fill each day
Grocery lists
???? the ?car?

Now crowded rooms
make it easier
to forget
I'm alone

It's only when the moon is high
I start to miss you standing by
But I'm afraid if I wish tonight
My lucky star will be out of sight
Oh, be still, my little heart

Oh, be still, my little heart
</pre>
