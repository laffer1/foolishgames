<h1>Yo</h1>
<pre>
by Atz Kilcher


As sung by Jewel and Atz Kilcher
Transcribed by Michelle Thomas

* Jewel and Atz together

A little yodeling song
for my man Yo
And I know that Yo don't know
That I wrote this song a late one night
He'd heard me yodeling down at Hobo Gin's
And we were hanging out at the Putter Inn
He was beggin me to yodel
And Oh Yo he wasn't half the type
He held out his hand
I said "What's your name?"
And he said "Yo"
So I asked him again
And he said "Yo" again
So I figured it must be his name
Well I was having some perculiar thoughts
But you can't say much with a name like Atz
So I settled back
Tried to figure out Yo-yo's game
Now Yo was sailin three sheets of the wind
With a frozen stare
And an ear-to-ear grin
He kept beggin me to yodel, sayin
"G-gget up there and yodel with the band"
It was my good friend Rod with a hired gun
So I stepped up to have a little bit of fun
With the lead, and the bass and the drummer and the rhythm man
Now Yo he staggered right up to the stage
He had this angelic smile on his face
That sucker looked like he floated up to heaven and he died
While I never had a fan quite like Yo before
He stood there mesmerized on the floor
He started stompin and clappin when he heard my yodeling cry

(chorus)
And I said
*Yo This yodeling song's for you
No matter where you go
No matter what you do
Remember that time spent yodeling's time well spent
I've never had myself a fan club before
But Yo don't you know that one thing's for sure
If I do I'll make you my fan club president

And I said
 *(Yodel)

Well when I got through
I said "There you go Yo"
And he was still smiling but his eyes were still closed
And I thought I was going to get away from him
But then he opened them wide and said
"I-II want to hear some more"
Well I was wearing out my welcome and I was running out of time
But I decided that I'd yodel up another line
Cause I thought it was the only way I could get Yo off the floor
Then I got to thinking
I realized
Suddenly I realized
Why old Yo liked yodeling
Because everytime I yodeled I was saying Yo's name
Well then I got to thinking it probably wouldn't work too well
In fact it downright sounds like hell
If you ever try to yodel using anybody elses name

Try Inga
*Inga-lay (etc.)

See what I mean It just doesn't work

So In this whole wide world
No matter where I go
One thing I've learned
I've finally know
I'll never yodel again if there's anyone in the audience named Yo

And I said
*Yo This yodeling song's for you
No matter where you go
No matter what you do
Remember that time spent yodeling's time well spent
I've never had myself a fan club before
But Yo don't you know that one thing's for sure
If I do I'll make you my fan club president

And I said
 *(Yodel)
  (long yodel)
