<h1>Leave the Lights on</h1>

<pre>
I like your smile
Don't like complication
I like your style
Don't like calculation
Come towards me, dear
There's something u need 2 hear


CHORUS

I said If u want my love
U can try my love
U can't buy my love
Just take my hand
If u want me, dear
Then just beckon, dear
And I will appear
I said-u can leave the lights on
U can leave the lights on

I believe in love, dear
Without limitation
Believe in being clear
2 avoid aggravation
If u want me 2
I will exist just for u


CHORUS

I will mesmerize with milky thighs and languid eyes, I'll prophesize your moans and sighs
Just look at me sacredly, religiously, hungrily, let your eyes say, "Please," I will not leave


CHORUS
</pre>
