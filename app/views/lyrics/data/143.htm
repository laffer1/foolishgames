<h1>Silver Satin Wings</h1>
<pre>
"I don't mean to be bad," said the bubble headed blonde,
and it was probably true.
"But what else can you do when looks are all people notice
and looks are all that they want, too."

And now she's sitting in the bedroom and she's crying
Now she lies beneath his silver satin
wings Cause she was never raised to know any better
because he is the best thing she has ever seen

And Papa said she's too cute for words
So she never learned how to speak
And mama said she don't need to read
just a hot mercedes and a decent man that won't (spring a leak)?
So now she's sitting in the bedroom and she's crying
Now she lies beneath his silver satin wings
Cause she was never raised to know any better
because he is the best thing she has ever seen

In school all she learned that talk is cheap
but looks they come for free
They said "Hey, why try and think girl, if you can smile
and get anything you need?"

So now she's sitting in the bedroom and she's crying
Now she lies beneath his silver satin wings
Cause she was never raised to know any better
because he is the best thing she has ever seen

She said "Sometimes there's this fear inside
that cannot sleep at night, though he is sleeping fine
And I used to like the way he talked
before I knew promises were just other words for 'goodbye'."

See now she's sitting in the bedroom and she's crying
As she lies beneath his silver satin wings

Cause she was never raised to know any better
because he is the best thing she
He is the best thing she will ever see.
