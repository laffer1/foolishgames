<h1>Tiny Love Spaces</h1>
<pre>
I don't care if you leave your name after the beep.
Don't care if those are promises you intend to keep.
Cause lovers are just shadows that disappear with the light
And my happiness don't depend on if you come tonight.
Ahoh-oh oh

I don't think that you're cheap
I don't expect anything
You don't gotta leave what time you called on my machine.
Cause being in love just means calling places
when you can't afford the bill
Cause we all got these tiny love spaces that we need to fill
Ohoh oo

Filling up tiny love spaces
Getting lost inside of insatiable mazes
Looking for heroes in worn-out faces
Looking for a great big love in tiny places

You wake up, it's the next morning
Put my high-powered columbian crystals in the coffee machine
Read the newspaper, drink six cups of cofee, listen to Mozart's Fifth
Do most anything not to hear the phone ring
Oh oo ooooo

And I don't mind that you're emotionally blind
Don't care if I'm someone you want to see
You don't got to leave your number for me.
Cause I do not need your fuckin' phone calls telling me how you feel
I only just need to make love to tell me that I'm real

Cause we all got these tiny love spaces that we need to fill
Ohoh oooo
</pre>
