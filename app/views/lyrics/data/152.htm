<h1>Sunshine Superman</h1>
<pre>
by Donovan

Sunshine came softly through my window today
I could have tripped out easy but I've changed my ways.
It'll take time I know it, but in a while...
You're gonna be mine and I know it, we'll do it in style.

Cause I've made my mind up you're going to be mine
I'll tell you right now...
Any trick in the book, oh baby, that I can find.
Everybody's hustling just to have a little scene.
When I say we'll be cool, well, I think that, you know what I mean.
We stood on a beach at sunset, do you remember when...
I know a beach where baby, it never ends.

When you've made your mind up forever to be mine.
I'll pick up your hand and slowly, blow your little mind.
Cause I've made my mind up you're going to be mine
I'll tell you right now...
Any trick in the book, oh baby, that I can find

Superman or Green Lantern ain't got, nothin' on me.
I can make like a turtle and dive for pearls in the sea
You can just sit there thinkin', on your velvet throne
About all the rainbows you can have for your own.

When you've made your mind up forever to be mine.

I'll tell you right now...
I'll pick up your hand and slowly, blow your little mind.

When you've made your mind up forever to be mine.
I'll pick up your hand and slowly, blow your little mind.

I'll tell you right now...
