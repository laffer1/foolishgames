<h1>Goodwill Store</h1>

Written by Elizabeth Hummell
Some collaboration with Steve Poltz
Covered by Jewel at concerts

I'm on the edge of my seat
In the soup of my soul
In the center of time
I'm in a sentimental role
You're a stranger of mine
And I'm a stranger of yours
But I seen you in the window
At the Goodwill Store

And I seen you in the window
At the Goodwill Store
Seen you in the window
At the Goodwill Store
Honey, open up
You don't need to shut down
Cause we're gonna blow the hell
Outta this town

I got these really cool boots
That zip up the side
With a little bit of fur
On the Naga hide
And you found a metal
From the Vietnam war
And I seen you in the window
At the Goodwill Store

And I seen you in the window
At the Goodwill Store
Seen you in the window
At the Goodwill Store
Honey, open up
You don't need to shut down
Cause we're gonna blow the hell
Outta this town

And there's a Lutheran lady
With blueish hair
We'll show you to the drawer
Of underwear
And I'm wondering if
This camera really works
And then I meet your eyes
Near the fifty-cent shirts

And I seen you in the window
At the Goodwill Store
Seen you in the window
At the Goodwill Store
Honey, open up
You don't need to shut down
Cause we're gonna blow the hell
Outta this town

And you find boxers
With little blue sheep
And I find a tutu
I can finally keep
If we've been here once
You know we've been here before
And I seen you in the window
At the Goodwill Store

Well wear what you want to
And wear it with pride
Cause it's a big, bad, cold, hard
World outside
And when you're burned out
Heart sick and sore
We can sit down on the sofa
At the Goodwill Store

And I seen you in the window
At the Goodwill Store
Seen you in the window
At the Goodwill Store
Honey, open up
You don't need to shut down
Cause we're gonna blow the hell
Outta this town

I'm on the edge of my seat
In the soup of my soul
In the center of time
I'm in a sentimental role
