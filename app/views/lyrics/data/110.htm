<h1>Let Them In</h1>
<pre>Also performed by David Wilcox
Duet by Jewel and Edwin McCain (Radio Angels)
written by John Gorka


Let them in, Peter
They are very tired
Give them couches where the angels sleep
And light those fires
Let them wake up whole again
To brand new dawns
And fired by the sun
Not wartimes bloody guns
And may their peace be deep
Remember where the broken bodies lie
God knows how young they were to have to die
Well, God knows how young they were to have to die

[Jewel]
Give them things they like
Let them make some noise
Give dancehall bands not golden harps to these our boys
Let them love, Peter
For they've had no time
They should have trees, birdsongs
And hills to climb
The taste of summer
In a ripened pear
And girls as sweet as meadow wind with flowing hair
And tell them how they are missed
But say not to fear
It's gonna be all right with us down here
It's gonna be all right with us down here

[Edwin &amp; Jewel]
Let them in, Peter
For they are very tired
Give them couches where the angels sleep
And light those fires
Let them wake up whole again
To brand new dawns
And fired by the sun
Not wartimes bloody guns
And may their peace be deep
Remember where the broken bodies lie
God knows how young they were to have to die
And tell them how they are missed
But say not to fear
It's gonna be all right with us down here
It's gonna be all right with us down here
