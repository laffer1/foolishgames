<h1>Angel Standing By</h1><pre>All through the night I'll be standing over youAll through the night I'll be watching over youAnd through the bad dreams I'll be right there, babyHolding your hand, telling you everything is all rightAnd when you cry I'll be right thereTelling you you were never anything less than beautifulSo don't you worryI'm your Angel standing by</pre>
