<h1>A Very Big Girl</h1>
<pre>
They say you're feeling charitable
And that she's just a helpless little girl
You say she needs counseling
But I find it hard to believe
Cause baby looks like
A very big girl to me

You say she's harmless
I don't know about that
She's just a kitty but to me
Looks like a very capable cat
What'cha say about that?
You say she's unattractive
She doesn't turn you on
But that expression on your face
Ain't exactly a yawn
You say she needs advising
But I find it hard to believe
Caus baby looks like
A very big girl to me

Yeah that cupcake
Don't exactly look like no hostess to me
Cause baby looks like
A very big girl to me
</pre>
