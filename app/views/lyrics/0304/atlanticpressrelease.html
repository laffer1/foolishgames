  <pre>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE        DRAFT ONLY<br />APRIL X, 2003
<br />RADIO MOVES TO JEWEL'S NEW BEAT:<br />&quot;INTUITION&quot; FEELS LIKE AN OUT-THE-BOX SMASH; <br />NEW ALBUM, &quot;0304,&quot; PREMIERES JUNE 3rd 
<br />	In its first week at radio stations, &quot;Intuition,&quot; the new single from<br />Atlantic recording artist Jewel, has been greeted with an instant,<br />overwhelmingly positive reaction from coast to coast.   Even before its<br />official add date, the song is already on the air in a host of major<br />markets, including New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Washington D.C.,<br />Charlotte, Atlanta, Tampa, Orlando, Miami, Houston, Pittsburgh, Columbus,<br />Cleveland, Indianapolis, St. Louis, Sacramento, Seattle, and many others. <br />Listeners across the country are calling their local stations with a flood<br />of requests and praise for the song.<br /> 	&quot;Intuition&quot; is the first track from Jewel's forthcoming fifth album,<br />entitled &quot;0304.&quot;  Slated to be in stores on June 3rd, the album finds the<br />multi-platinum singer/songwriter moving in new musical directions inspired<br />by her burgeoning interest in modern dance beats and textures.  The song<br />was written and produced by Jewel and Cuban-American producer Lester<br />Mendez (Shakira, Santana, Enrique Iglesias), who collaborated with her<br />throughout the new album.  A companion video for &quot;Intuition,&quot; directed by<br />Marc Klasfeld (Sum 41, Floetry, Vanessa Carlton, Nelly, Alien Ant Farm),<br />is currently in production.<br />	Jewel will perform &quot;Intuition&quot; live on national television for the first<br />time when she appears on NBC-TV?s Toyota Concert Series on Today on<br />Friday, May 2nd.  A month later, on Monday, June 2nd, she will herald the<br />arrival of &quot;0304&quot; with a special eve-of-release performance on NBC-TV's<br />Tonight Show with Jay Leno.<br />	In other Jewel news, &quot;Intuition&quot; has also been chosen by Schick to be<br />used as the music for a major national television advertising campaign to<br />launch the company?s new all-in-one shaver for women, also called<br />Intuition?.  Jewel will perform &quot;Intuition&quot; live in a special concert at<br />Schick's Intuitionfest? 2003, taking place in New York's Central Park on<br />Saturday, May 10th.<br />Since the release of her first album eight years ago, Jewel has continued<br />to explore fresh avenues, branching out from her folk roots to incorporate<br />rock, pop, country, blues, jazz, and classical influences into her work. <br />Each successive album has found her experimenting with new sounds and<br />widening her artistic scope, while retaining her uniquely personal lyrical<br />style and musical authenticity.  Still in her twenties, Jewel enjoys a<br />rare career longevity among her generation of artists.  Her four previous<br />albums have sold 25 million copies worldwide.</pre>
