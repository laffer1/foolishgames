      <h1>Spirit</h1>    <h2>Absence of Fear</h2>     <pre>inside my skin there is this space it twists and turns it bleeds and aches inside my heart there's an empty room it's waiting for lightning it's waiting for you and i am wanting and i am needing you here inside the absence of fearmuscle and sinew velvet and stone this vessel is haunted it creaks and moans my bones call to you in their separate skin i make myself translucent to let you in, for i am wanting and i am needing you here inside the absence of fearthere is this hunger this restlessness inside of me and it knows that you're no stranger you're my gravity my hands will adore you through all darkness aim they will lay you out in moonlight and reinvent your name for i am wanting you and i am needing you here i need you near inside the absence of fear    </pre>
