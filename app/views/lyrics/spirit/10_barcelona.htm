      <h1>Spirit</h1>    <h2>Barcelona</h2>    <pre>barcelona where the winds all blew and the churches don't have windows but the graveyards do me and my barcelona where the winds all blew and the churches don't have windows but the graveyards do me and my shadow are wrestling again look out stranger, there's a dark cloud moving inbut if you could hear the voice in my heart it would tell you i’m afraid i am alone won't somebody please hold me, release me show me the meaning of mercy let me loose fly, let me fly, let me flysuper paranoid, i'm blending, i'm blurring, i'm bleeding into the scenery loving someone else is always so much easier but i hold myself hostage in the mirrorbut if you could hear the voice in my heart it would tell you i'm tired of feeling this way god, won't you please hold me, release me show me the meaning of mercy let me looselet me fly, let me fly, let me fly i won't be held down, i won't be held back i will lead with my faith the red light has been following me but don't worry mother it's no longer my gravityhold me, release me show me the meaning of mercy let me fly, let me fly, let me fly    </pre>
