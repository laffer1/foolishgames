  <h2>Lyrics</h2>  <h3>This Way Press Release - Atlantic Records</h3>  <p>JEWEL: &#147;THIS WAY&#148;<br>    NEW ALBUM DUE NOVEMBER 13TH<br>    FIRST SINGLE, &#147;STANDING STILL,&#148; READY TO MOVE<br>    <br>    Atlantic Records has announced that the eagerly awaited fourth album from     Jewel, entitled &#147;THIS WAY,&#148; will be released by the label on November     13th. &#147;THIS WAY&#148; is Jewel&#146;s first album since the 1999 release     of &#147;JOY: A HOLIDAY COLLECTION,&#148; and marks her first album of all-new,     self-penned material since 1998&#146;s &#147;SPIRIT.&#148; </p>  <p>The album&#146;s first single, &#147;Standing Still,&#148; with lyrics by     Jewel and music by Jewel and Rick Nowles, is set to ship to radio outlets     nationwide this week. The companion video clip, directed by Darren Grant (Destiny&#146;s     Child), is slated to make its premiere later this month.</p>  <p>Recorded in Nashville, &#147;THIS WAY&#148; was produced by Dann Huff and     Jewel, marking her first work as a producer. One of the top guitarists in     the business, Huff has become a much in-demand producer in recent years, with     a diverse list of credits ranging from Megadeth to Faith Hill. </p>  <p>&#147;I wanted to focus on the craft of performing and songwriting,&#148;     says Jewel. &#147;I&#146;ve always been a live musician, and I wanted my voice     to shine through. At the same time, I hope to stay relevant as a writer, which     means staying honest about where you are. The most important thing to me is     maintaining my authenticity. I&#146;ll always be curious musically and want     to try new things, but above all, I want the music to sound honest and good     in 20 years.&#148;</p>  <p>Jewel&#146;s three previous albums - &#147;PIECES OF YOU&#148; (1995), &#147;SPIRIT&#148;     (1998), and &#147;JOY: A HOLIDAY COLLECTION&#148; (1999) - have together sold     over 23 million copies worldwide. &#147;PIECES OF YOU&#148; earned the prestigious     Diamond Award from the RIAA for U.S. sales of 10 million units, and has passed     the 11 million mark in America alone. </p>
