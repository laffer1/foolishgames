<h1>Under The Water</h1>
<pre>
Written by Jewel Kilcher &amp; Ralph Sall
From "The Craft" Soundtrack

Bees are buzzin' in their honey catacomb
All the noise seems to call my head a home
Can't escape the scratchin'
My blood makes a noise
It's hard not to play when there are so many toys
So many toys

Under the water
The total is more than the sum
Under the water
I hear who I'll become

There's a hole inside my head where all the thoughts break out
Sometimes my flesh is filled with forgetfulnes and doubt
It's easy to feel separate, no control of the reigns
Innocence ain't lost it just needs to be maintained
It needs to be maintained

Beside me are strange fish, moody and dark
A tapestry of intention that maintains the spark
And there's a tiny light
A flicker within
Forgiveness is the needle that knows how to mend
It knows how to mend

Under the water
The total is more than the sum
Under the water
I hear who I'll become

(Spoken "Rap")
I've decided to hear who we will become
Wanna lay down in the water, go back to where I'm from
Outer space is just a puzzle of stars
Music the mechanics of the human heart
A post that stirs, a shadow that casts
An insatiable thirst drains a martini glass
There's no place sacred, no honest reflection
Our senses made senseless by a lack o' direction
Monks are great with their fists uncurled
But they live in a cave, they know nothin' of the world
I wanna live brave, I wanna love without fear
But it's hard to navigate when I can't even hear

(Do do do do do do do,
Do do do do)

Bees are buzzin' in their honey catacomb
All the noise seems to call my head a home
Can't escape the scratchin'
My blood makes a noise
It's hard not to play when there are so many toys
There're so many toys

Under the water
The total is more than the sum
Under the water
I hear who I'll become

Under the water
My flesh is filled with stars
Under the water
I hear who we really are

Under the water
I lay my burdens down, down, down
Under the water
All resistance drowns

(Do do do do do do do, Do do do do)
(Do do do do do do do, Do do do do)
(Do do do do do do do, Do do do do)
(Do do do do do do do, Do do do do)
(Do do do do do do do, Do do do do)

Come on, come down, down, down under go,
A-go down on and go down under
Go under the water
I hear who I'll become

Under the water
I lay my problems down
Under the water
All my resistance drowned
