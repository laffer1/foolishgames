<h1>Just So Happens</h1>
<pre>
Just so happens that Im tired of your face
Just so happens that Im tired of this place
Just so happens that I can not endure
The pain and the suffering thats caused when I touch you anymore

Just so happens that Im tired of this song
Cuz everything I ever tried to do just came out wrong
And every honest thing I ever tried to do
Was turned to pain and misery when laid before the godly feet of you

Theres no words left to say
Cuz all the words between us have already gone away

It just so happens that my flesh is turning pale
And pieces of me are disappearing as though my hands were whales
And it just so happens beauty, you could never recognize
And I simply faded away, before your eyes

Just so happens that these last two years
Been a completely meaningless waste of my tears
And if I had a toothpick for every vow you made
Id build a boat of your promises, and Id sail away

Theres no words left to say
Cuz all the words between us have already gone away

Just so happens itd take a swift kick to the heart
To make you take back everything that you said
Just so happens that we stuck around too long
We should have abandoned ship, rather than go down with it, now its gone

Just so happens that I hate your mother-in-law
And I hate your dog, Henry, Id like to fondle him with a saw
Just so happens that Im walking out the door
And p.s., and by the way, I dont love you anymore

Theres no words left to say
Cuz all the words between us have already gone,
theyve already gone
theyve already gone away
