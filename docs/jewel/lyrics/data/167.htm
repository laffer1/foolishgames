<h1>Without You By My Side</h1>
<pre>
I lie so tired in my bed
and moon shows herself to the door
and I shut my eyes.
I pray to God, won't you tell me please,
what's a girl like me doing
lying here without you by my side?
Lying here without you by my side
Lying here without you by my side

The room fills with moonlight and memories of old times,
but don't worry about me, I'm just fine most of the time.
The hardest part is late night, when I'm home all alone,
and the house is so still nothing better to do than think about you.
I'm Lying here without you by my side
I'm Lying here without you by my side

How quick my heart wants to believe, I'll never be lonely again.
It's those little things I never thought about much, that I miss most in the
end.
Like those sweet red-wine kisses, and the candlelight,
and the poetry, but mainly, it's just the warmth of your skin,
and having you by my side,
I'm Lying here without you by my side

There's this weight in my heart, it's so heavy, so sad,
it felt like a wave that any moment comes crashing down,
and maybe my sorrow will drown tomorrow
when I'm lying here without you by my side
I'm Lying here Without You by my Side
