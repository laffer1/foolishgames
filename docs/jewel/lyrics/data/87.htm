<h1>Grey Matter</h1>
<pre>
I hate you, I love you
Leave, please don't go away
Can't decide if I like your face
Or if I wish it would stray

You're a child but you're malicious
You're sweet but don't remember my name
And heads you win and tails I'm lost
And love equals pain

I am drifting without an anchor
Through your ambigous region
A strange continent immune to all reason
And I'm flattered by your grey matter

Inside my skin, I feel your tongue
Telling me I'm dirty and licking my bones
A surge against silence, a knife across a plate
Makes the sound of need on hate

I am drifting without an anchor
Through your ambigous region
A strange continent immune to all reason
And I'm flattered by your grey matter
And I do not understand why a woman can't just love a man

You're amusing you're a real cool show
With your meat hooks and barbed wire carnival
You got glitter in your pocket
You got mothballs in your soul
From too many false teeth and greasy flash bulbs

I am drifting without an anchor
Through your ambigous region
A strange continent immune to all reason
And I'm flattered by your grey matter

I love you
I hate you
