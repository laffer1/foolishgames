<h1>Money</h1>
<pre>
Do you see the big fat man
With a skinny skimpy blonde who lets him kiss her hand?
Because he, ooh, breathes diamond rings when he sings
And he talks like Columbian coffee with cream
And it's not, ooh, too sweet

Money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money, yeah-yeah
Money makes the world go round, round, round, round, round

A blur of cheap hotel rooms, a vibrating bed
It's hot feelings, cold feet, hey, yo, gimme some
Head into the bathroom just to powder her nose
Paint her fingernails and paint her toes
And it's all, ooh, for more money

Money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money, yeah-yeah
Money makes the world go round, round, round, round, round

She used to be pretty with a real cute face
Dreams and morals lit by her internal fireplace
Then in came the shadow man, he blew out her light
And now, just like so many, her life is just a fight
It's a fight for more money

Money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money, yeah-yeah
Money makes the world go round, round, round, round, round
Yeah, yeah-yeah

Do you see the big fat man
With a skinny skimpy blonde who lets him kiss her hand?
Because he, ooh, breathes diamond rings when he sings
He talks like Columbian coffee with cream
And it's not, ooh, too, ooh, sweet

Money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money, yeah-yeah
Money makes the world...
Money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money, yeah-yeah
Money makes the world go round
