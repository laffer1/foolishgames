<h1>In a Woman's Life (Santa Cruz Feb 26, 96)</h1>
<pre>
Somewhere between right and wrong is a love song
Its tongue hits the target but its phone number is always wrong
It speaks through calluses of gentler things
It speaks of kindness
But I don't think you know what that word means
Your love is a bitter seed that only the blind can see
If this is what love is
Then I guess there's no love song left in me

Somewhere between right and wrong is reality
Justice and shame speak foolishly of impractical things
Your kisses are as kind as candles
your hands are as giving as stone
Your mind is kind as Hitler's until night leaves you feeling alone
Your love is something I must do but never be
If this is what love is
Then I guess there's no love song left in me

I didn't mean to fall into darkness
It's just that I trip in the lights
Cause aw man it's hard to see that clearly and not put up a fight
But I knew I wpould break and not bend
Just look at this trouble I'm in
I need to realize
This is how the unhappy half dies

Somewhere between good and bad is every lie I have ever been told
They all come down but good deeds don't count it's what cards you hold
But I'm tired of your grey laughter
I am tired of your hungry eyes
This love is so rotten
It's startin' to attract flies
Your love is something that must do but never be
Its blade is made of jealousy and insecurity
Your love is a bitter seed that only the blind can see
If this is what love is
If this is what love is
Then I guess there's no love song left in me.
</pre>
