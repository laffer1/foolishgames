<h1>Happy Endings (Houston, TX Version)</h1>
<pre>
Transcribed by Rowdy White
7/10/1999

The room is full
and we're dancing slow
the band is playing
an old country tune
(and cowboy's will be bringing
their ladies home soon)

and I don't wanna hear
no more sad songs
don't (know) happy ones no more
the worlds full of broken hearts
and I'm not pretending
but is it asking too much
for just one happy ending?
tonight I need an happy ending

Outside the night is still
and the moon's hanging low
and tomorrow can conquer
with its tyranny and (noise)
but tonight I'm taking a (stand)

Cause I don't wanna hear
no more sad songs
don't (know) happy ones no more
the world's full of broken hearts
and, hey, I'm not pretending
but is it asking too much
for just one happy ending?
Tonight I need a happy ending
So hold me tight
hold me dear
whisper quietly
so my heart can't hear
no more sad songs
no more sad songs
So hold me tight
and pray this night never ends
don't make me lonely
and don't make me blue
don't say goodnight
just say you want a
happy ending.

Cause I don't wanna hear
no more sad songs
don't (know) happy ones nomore
the worlds full of broken hearts
and I'm not pretending
but is it asking too much
for just one happy ending?
Tonight I need a happy ending...
Just one happy ending
tonight I need a
happy ending..
