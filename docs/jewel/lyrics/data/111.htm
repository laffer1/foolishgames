<h1>Life's a Great Big Mystery Show</h1>
<pre>
Transcribed by Tom Proven

Went downtown just to be a martyr
but a telephone pole beat me to it
it was covered in barbed wire
Saw a little boy's white teeth
like wild horses encaged by an iron string

Oh god...does not feel good unless he bleeds

And daily crucifictions are hung up on street signs
they use all sorts of names
hope they never use mine
these consonants and vowels
that cannot scream nor howl
only just hang around

Oh god...how'd things get so turned around

and in the office building
9 to 5 goes on trial
the man is startin to crack
but the ceiling stones smile
and the boss comes in
to see what fragile things
his dull and pointless tongue can tear

Oh god...he combed over a baldspot with a bit of hair

Cause everybody needs
somebody else to blame
they can't curse themselves
they take their doctor's name in vain
they'd rather jump through hoops
and theraputic groups
than in their own minds delve

oh god...why don't we believe in ourselves

Sometimes
I think
Life is just a movie
and these
strangers
are folks we really know
sit back
relax
enjoy some popcorn
Life's a great big mystery show

Saw tiny faces that are tattered and torn
but there's paint upon the mansion that is hardly worn
I'd like to go inside
but why I don't know
as though I could peel the paint
and feed it to the poor

oh god...can't live like this anymore

my landlord..no...
my neighbor is as tolerant as a feeding shark
but they tell me that her bite is much better than her bark
she goes ramblin on
from dusk until dawn
sayin I should try bein' like her sometime

oh god...think somethin's died inside her mind

cause
sometimes...

Life's a great big mystery show
