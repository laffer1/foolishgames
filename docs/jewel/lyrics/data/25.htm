<h1>Medley</h1>
  <pre>a) Go Tell It On the Mountain</pre>     <pre>when i was a seeker 
i sought both night and day 
i asked the lord to help me 
and he showed me the way</pre>
    <pre>go tell it on the mountain 
over the hills and ev'rywhere 
go tell it on the mountain 
that Jesus Christ is born</pre>
    <pre>he made me a watchman 
up on the city wall 
and if I am a Christian 
I am the least of all</pre>
    <pre>go tell it on the mountain 
over the hills and ev'rywhere 
go tell it on the mountain 
that Jesus Christ is born</pre>

    <pre>while shepherds kept their watching 
o'er wand'ring flock by night 
behold! from out of the heavens 
there shown a holy light</pre>
    <pre>go tell it on the mountain 
over the hills and ev'rywhere 
go tell it on the mountain 
that Jesus Christ is born 
go tell it on the mountain 
over the hills and ev'rywhere
 go tell it on the mountain 
that Jesus Christ is born</pre>
    <pre>b) From a Distance</pre>
    <pre>God is watching us, God is watching us 
God is watching us from a distance 
God is watching us, God is watching us 
God is watching us … 
(from a distance)</pre>
    <pre>c) Life Uncommon</pre>
    <pre>i've heard your anguish 
oh! i've heard your hearts cry out 
we're tired, oh! we are weary 
oh! we aren't worn out 
set down your chains 
’til only faith remains 
set down your chains</pre>

    <pre>and lend your voices 
only to sounds of freedom 
oh, no longer lend your strength to that 
which you wish to be free from 
fill your lives with love and brav'ry 
and we shall lead a life uncommon</pre>
    <pre>there are plenty of people 
who pray for peace 
but if praying were enough 
oh! it would have come to be 
don't ever let your words enslave no one 
and the heavens will hush themselves 
to hear our voices ring out clear 
with sounds of freedom 
sounds of freedom</pre>
    <pre>come on you unbelievers 
oh! move out of the way 
there is a new army coming 
oh! and we are armed with faith 
oh! live, oh! we must give 
oh! live</pre>
    <pre>and lend our voices only to sounds of freedom 
no longer lend your strength 
to that which you wish to be free from 
fill your lives with love and brav'ry 
and we shall lead 
a life uncommon 
fill your lives with love and brav'ry 
oh! and we shall lead 
a life uncommon</pre>
    <pre>(From a Distance again)</pre>
    <pre>god is watching us, god is watching us, 
god is watching us from a distance</pre>

    <pre>god is watching us, god is watching us,
god is watching us from a distance</pre>
