<h1>Need A Piece Of Your Love Machine</h1>
<pre>
It's been seven hours and sixteen days
Since pollination has come my way
I sit around like dirty cups 'n the spoons
Stacking up around your room

Are you gonna come and pick me up
Stick your finger in my buttercup
What's wrong with me?
Just need a piece of your love machine

The yellow sun is just like chicken soup
Both are wasted if they don't get used
I'm like a petal that needs to be plucked
Come on daddy, Let's duck

All resistance like Vietnam
You be my trader
I'll be your Viet Cong

What's wrong with me
Just need a piece of your love machine

You were my Romeo
I was your Juliet
Hiding in the trash can
We both got wet

You fed me chicken chow-mein
Our love was spicy, yet plain
You built a giant ship and you sailed with it

But now you're gone
Gone
Gone

What's a rose if it won't be smelled
What's a texture if it won't be felt

You wear a plaid like there' no tomorrow
It spills out of the closet
I think that I'll borrow

Some pants or some underwear
There's a trace of you under there
What's wrong with me
Just need a piece of your love machine
