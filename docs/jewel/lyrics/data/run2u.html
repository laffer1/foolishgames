<h1>Run 2 U</h1>

<pre>
Hey little baby, little lover boy
Get in my arms, give me some joy
I wanna hold u tonight
It'll be alright
'Cause the night is long and I hunt for u In this darkest hour, where have u gone 2? Won't u come 2 my side I need u tonight


CHORUS

Run 2 me, I'll run 2 u Let me crash into uRun 2 u, you'll run 2 me I alone can love u U belong 2 me

I need u for dark reasons, dear
For greed and lust and seed and fear
For all the songs that I can hear when u are near
'Cause the places I've been, well I'm trying 2 forget
But the further I run, well, the further I get
But with just one kiss, u know that it do not exist
So won't u dance for me beneath the street lamp's light
With your arms stretched out, baby, drunk on wine
U know it feels so good, like it should, just 2 laugh
I knew that it would


CHORUS

La, la, la, close your eyes
La, la, la, it's a lullaby


CHORUS
</pre>
