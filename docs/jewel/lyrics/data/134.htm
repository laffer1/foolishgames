<h1>Rosy and Mick</h1>
<pre>
Transcribed by Cymbaline (cymbaline@earthmax.net)


Mick came home late last night
he drank enough beer to take the edge off a knife
She opened the door
looking older than before
He said "Rosy, you're too girl a girl"

She let him in and lifted up her dress
like an apology he began to kiss her neck
he felt much relief
as the ceiling fan tapped out a broken melody

And she said "Do you remember when we were younger,
bitter words were said
making up was always your favorite part.
Well I ain't young no more
and 'I'm sorry' can not mend a broken heart."

He came back home
threw his things on the floor
she worked up the courage to see what she never had before
the words got lost inside
he got that look in his eye
and the sun went shining on

Do you remember when we were younger
bitter words were said
making up was always your favorite part
well I 'aint young no more
and "I'm sorry" can not mend a broken heart

The church knew well Mick was a violent man
She got a few head lines
she got a slap on the hand

And there ain't no vilians
and there ain't no heros
people on both sides of the tracks
try to add a whole bunch of zeros
time marches on
until its all gone

She said, "Do you remember when we were younger
bitter words were said
making up was always your favorite part
I ain't young no more
and 'I'm sorry' can not mend a broken heart"
