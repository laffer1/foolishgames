<h1>The Water is Wide (Jewel version)</h1>
<pre>
The water is wide, I cant cross o'er
And neither I have wings to fly
Give me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row - my love and I

Now love is gentle love is kind
The sweetest flower when first its new
But love grows cold and waxes cold
And fades away like morning dew

There is a ship she sails the sea
Shes loaded deep as deep as can be
But not as deep as the love im in
I know not how I sink or swim

The water is wide I cant cross o'er
And neither I have wings to fly
Give me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row - my love and I
And both shall row - my love and I
</pre>
