<h1>When I Was With You</h1>
<pre>
by Jewel Kilcher and Joy Eden Harrison

Do you remember when we were younger,
All those crazy things that we used to do?
You'd play my hips like drumsets
And sing all your favorite Stevie Wonder tunes
When I was with ya.

Do you remember we did everything together?
I'd share my otter pops with you.
And we would sing in all the slimy slimy barrooms
We'd watch for your cousin Ed on the evening news
When I was with ya

I'd warm your tootsies up, they're always so cold
And I'd fix you supper from leftovers two weeks old
And I'd read you the classified ads in bed
And you would point out all the miserable lives
That I could have had instead of being with you

Could've been Whoopi Goldberg's breasts

Do you remember when you wrote all those letters?
Though I admit they were kind of sick
But still I knew I was your honey sugar dumpling
And just like a good lime you'd alweys be there to lick
When I was with ya

Do you remember when you took all those classes?
All those crazy gadgets you would fix
I hated how cluttered our apartment was
I hated our landlord Harry, he was such a dick
When I was with ya

I'd warm your tootsies up, they're always so cold
And I'd fix you supper from leftovers two weeks old
And I'd read you the classified ads in bed
And you would point out all the miserable lives
that I could have had instead of being with you

Could've been Richard Nixon's last pair of
Clean underwear going down the river

Do you remember when we went to Mexico
and stayed in that cute little place
We were honin' our fine love-makin' skills
and you tattoed "I love you" on your face
When I was with ya

I still remember the last time that I saw you
You left me with a hotdog in my hand
Was it cause I didn't want a pickle or was it a pretty senorita
Oh well, there was always stuff that I didn't understand
When I was with ya

I'd warm your tootsies up, they're always so cold
And I'd fix you supper from leftovers two weeks old
And I'd read you the classified ads in bed
And you would point out all the miserable lives
that I could have had instead of being with you
Being with you
Being with you
