<h1>Last Dance Rodeo</h1>
<pre>
Transcribed by Ryan Doskocil

Your lungs fill up with concrete
Her voice is all you can hear
Red lips and a screwdriver
Wrapped around some mink-clad smear
And you know that she's a diamond
And it's damned you for sure (OR In this damn juke box hell)
'Cause fools gold only fools fools
In two-bit hotels.
But she's cooler than all that
She's a real high-class cat
She's queen of the last dance rodeo.

But under the gas lamp
The air is thick and velvety
Your bones filled with hunger
Your heart filled with longing
You're no longer human
You're an insatiable hole.
You wanna bury your face forever
In the navel of her soul
'Cause you know ...

All you need is a heart to call home
All you need is a heart to call home
That's all.

Light bulbs, and nylons
And plastic chandeliers
Objects are only objects,
They can't feel when you're near.
And tangerine lips
And lily-white breasts
These things are eternal
Inside them humanity rests.
The skin is like a seashell
You listen to the soul
Like an old-time radio show.

But under the gas lamp
The air is thick and velvety
Your bones filled with hunger
Your heart filled with longing

You're no longer human
You're an insatiable hole.
You wanna bury your face forever
In the navel of her soul
'Cause you know ...

All you need is a heart to call home
That's all.

But don't wander too far
On one constant star
Darkness exists, except where you are
Your feet are filled with wandering
They follow your own
'Cause everywhere you are
Feels like home.
So search all you miners
You hunters of dreams
Look in the alleyways
For what you know is not what it seems
And fame, all you maidens,
It don't exist too long
But at least look behind you
And see your own shadow's gone
Don't you know it's the last rodeo
You gotta find yourself a cowboy
Or someone to keep you
Warm when it snows.

But under the gas lamp
The air is thick and velvety
Your bones filled with hunger
Your heart filled with longing
You're no longer human
You're an insatiable hole.
You wanna bury your face forever
In the navel of her soul
'Cause you know ...

All you need is a heart to call home
All you need is a heart
All you need is a heart to call home
That's all.
