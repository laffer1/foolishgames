<h1>My Own Private God's Gift to Women</h1>
<pre>
Transcribed by James Reach
Corrections by Neal Copperman, and Gerrit Kruidhof

Would you like to ram your tongue down my throat
Would you like to grab my thighs
Yes, I have got nice tits
They are the perfect grab me size

I'm just a nice girl
Thought I had everything
Until you flashed me
And I saw what I've been missing

I've been saving myself my whole life
For some slimeball like you to come along
I am so desperate
I'll do you and your mom

     I get this tiny little boost of adrenaline
     When I think about what I've been given
     My own private god's gift to women
     My own private god's gift to women
     My own private god's gift to women
     Yeah, Yeah

I was just thinking that it'd really turn me on
If some guy would drive by and show me his tongue
I was just thinking that it'd really make my day
If he offered me a place to stay with pay

I'm just a nice girl
Thought I had everything
Until you flashed me
And I saw what I've been missing

I've been saving myself my whole life
for some sketcher like you to come along
I am so desperate
I'll do you on the front lawn

     I get this tiny little boost of adrenaline
     When I think about what I've been given
     My own private god's gift to women
     My own private god's gift to women
     My own private god's gift to women
     Yeah, Yeah

I was just thinking that it'd be really cool
If I got hit up side the head with a manly tool
That way he could have nothing left to say
And have his way with me all day

Cuz I'm just a nice girl
Thought I had everything
Until you flashed me
And I saw what I've been missing

I've been saving myself my whole life
For some motherfucker like you to come along
I am so desperate
I am writing you this song

And you're so vain
You probably think this song is about you

     I get this tiny little boost of adrenaline
     When I think about what I've been given
     My own private god's gift to women
     My own private god's gift to women
     My own private god's gift to women
