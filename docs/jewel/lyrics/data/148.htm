<h1>Stephenville</h1>
<pre>
Housewives trying to recapture their youth
By wearing floral print and suede
Fixing their hairdos with PC, chemical-free hairspray
Martha Stewart taught them to make on TV
I was raised a farmgirl
I'm too far from home, all alone on the road
Trying to figure out who I am now the the stardust has turned to sand
And the sand has turned to stone on the starmaking machine

I'm 25 years old
That ain't the end but it sure ain't where I began

And my daddy, he wrote songs and he broke colts
And he went back to school to get a degree
Now he teachs music to kids, he taught music to me
And this Alaskan girl was living in Stephenville, Texas
Yes, you guessed it, I moved here because I fell in love with a man And I moved his ex-old lady's things out of the closet The same closet I had to move my things back in It didn't make me feel that great, as if to demonstrate Everything's temporary given enough time But hey, I've got nothing to lose I'm a singer for crowds, I'm a writer of songs Hey Mom, look, I'm an entertainer I'm a modern day troubadour trying to find justice with six strings Trying to make the world make sense out of me
Trying to be loved completely, trying to love honestly
Trying to find a decent high noon cup of tea
In another shitty hotel
I'm trying to listen to the leaves speak
Trying to steal secrets from fishes in the creek
Trying to figure out who I am
A singer, a pretty bad cook, maybe a good mom
What will it be?

And I'm 25 years old
That ain't the end but it sure ain't where I began

I'm trying to figure out who I am
But there's no hand to hold, no Doctor Martin Luther King
There's just syncophants
And the mindlessness on TV or in the magazines
On the latest ways to behave
So why not follow me, the blond bombshell deity?
I'll sell you neat ideas without big words
And a little bit of cleavage to help wash it all down
Hey, everybody thought ? was a clown
And that ain't gonna be me

And I'm 25 years old
That ain't the end but it sure ain't where I began
And I'm 25 years old
That ain't the end but it sure ain't where I began
Guess that just means I'm in Texas
