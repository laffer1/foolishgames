<h1>So Close To Heaven</h1>
<pre>
I was just a child
When you took my hand
We set the whole damn world on fire
You showed me what it was to be
loved by a man
But one day the ax just fell
And the whole world got shot all to hell
There's a hole in my heart

We were so... So close to heaven
We were almost as good, as good
as it gets
And you were almost an angel
That was almost heaven sent
So close to heaven
So close

Our love was crazy and wild
Tender and mild, slow &amp; strong
Tonight I'll set it on fire
As noble as a storm
The lightning fell from your eyes
Suddenly, there was no goodbye
There's a hole in my heart

We were so... So close to heaven
We were almost as good, as good
as it gets
And you were almost an angel
That was almost heaven sent
So close to heaven
So close

Wax wings that flew too close to the sun
But wasn't it so fun to fly
It's far better to love than to lose
Than never to love, then to die
Oh you were so... So close to heaven
We were almost, almost, almost
as good as it gets
And you were almost an angel
Which was almost heaven sent
So close to heaven
so close... to heaven
So close.... to heaven
