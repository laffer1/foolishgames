<h1>Here When Gone</h1>
<pre>
I am a woman haunted by hands
Even though I'm alone
Traces of Pompey
Across my skin
And an invisible map
Of where you've been
It's dry road to Idaho
A thirsty tongue across the land
And soil so dry
You could swallow and entire man
Took the first road out of town
Hoping that you were just skin deep
Well I feel you like
Some sort of phantom limb
Beside me when I sleep
Cause you are here when gone
You are here when gone
You are here when gone
You are here when gone
I watch another grey day unfold
It's dusty wings
Sometimes I wish I were more like
Rocks and stones and things
Sometimes I wish my heart
Were not like flowers at all
That way I wouldn't get butterflies
When you called

-begin extra-
  And the night swallows itself
  You can see it in the stars
  The moon blinks it's tired eyes
  I may be a thousand miles to nowhere
  Does that make me lost or found?
  Oh - is it that relative to if you're around?
-end extra-

And some birds abandon their young
Cause the instinct is too strong to fly
Well I feel like abandoning
My guitar and my books and I'm afraid
I don't know why
Cause you are here when gone
You are here when gone
You are here when gone
You are here when gone
