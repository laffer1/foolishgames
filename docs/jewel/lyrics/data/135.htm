<h1>Run Tonto Run</h1>
<pre>
Don't even try
Don't want no piece of your sky
And I won't look back
Cause your blue is all black

Your twisted frown
Is really upside down
And it won't last long
Cause your right is all wrong

You live in a box
Miniature hands, tiny sox
Your love is a sigh
It just passes me by

I'm gonna run tonto run
Pale hollow frame
Run tonto run
You've let your blood in vein
Run tonto run away

Don't undress desire
It's always on fire
Strange hour fall down
I'm gonna burn down this town

A splinter in my vein
A volcano under rain
ALT (Your love the desert sands)
ALT (Go cut your hands)
Your in love with your clone
Which means you're alone

I'm gonna run tonto run
Pale hollow frame
Run tonto run
You've let your blood in vein
Run tonto run away

You disappear just like a wrapper in a candy store
And I am left wanting more

And don't even think
This ship won't sink
I won't hesitate
You'll choke on your hate

I'm gonna run tonto run
Pale hollow frame
Run tonto run
You've let your blood in vein
Run tonto run away
You better run tonto run
You better run tonto run
You better run tonto run away

And don't even try
Don't want no piece of your sky
And I won't hesitate
It's already too late
ALT (And I won't look back)
ALT (Cause your blue is all black)
