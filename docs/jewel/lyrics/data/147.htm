<h1>Star Child</h1>
<pre>
Transcribed by Adam Longfellow

A child 12 years of age stared into the sun
She stared into the bright lights of...
It imprinted upon her soul, mysteries of both young and old
And she close her eyes tight to feel the darkness

She's a dancing girl, dancing girl
She danced so fast, so fine
She danced around with her eyes shut
To see the stars in her mind
Spinning Jupiter, spinning Mars
She herself was just a singing star
A breathing constellation

Cause she's a bright point of light
Traveling through the skies of her mind
Oh and how she knew the stars
And the map of the human heart

For lengths of time, she'd stay in her mind
And follow roads back, ancient tracks and primitive times
And giant birds lifted themselves
Starry wings to burn white, fiery silhouettes in the sky

She's a dancing girl, dancing girl
She danced for them
And she followed all the lines back
To where they did begin
She saw her mother in pegas wings'
She felt her father in a scorpions' sting
A genetic constellation

She was a bright point of light
Traveling through the skies of her mind
Oh and how she knew the stars
And the map of the human heart

She saw bursting flowers...
Shooting stars who songs sang to her bones
She saw stories her grandfather used to tell
(His flesh) was frozen and kept so well
...meaning of the words, the pictures...
....?

She's a dancing girl, dancing girl
She danced so fast, so well
And she danced until her knees got weak
And all resistance fell
And all the walls, they came tumbling down
She stood eyes open, back on the ground
Why's it...glowing (glory) ?

She was a bright point of light
Traveling through the skies of her mind
Oh and how she knew the stars
And the map of the human heart
