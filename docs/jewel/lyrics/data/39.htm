<h1>Enter from the East</h1>
<pre>
i went out a-wandering 
beneath an unknown sky 
the heavens all shook violently 
he caught my eye 
strange fruit fell 
it struck me to the core 
my heart became a single flame 
it wanted nothing more

stranger, enter from the east 
stranger, step inside this place 
oh, and own me, own me

the clock became a bullet hole 
cruel and unkind 
it hurt me with its second hand 
alone another night

stranger, enter from the east 
stranger, step inside this place 
blue, is that you? 
well, don't bother knocking on my door this time 
blue, go be true for someone else 
there's no room inside this heart of mine our empty rooms

my heart has four empty rooms 
three wait for lightning and one waits for you

i must have you all to myself 
feel the full weight of your skin 
i'll hollow out my insides 
to place you in

stranger, enter from the east 
stranger, step inside this place 
oh, and own me, own me
</pre>
