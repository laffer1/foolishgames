<h1>No More Heartaches</h1>
<pre>
Shut up, sweetheart, I want you to hear
I can no longer love the same thing I fear
I can no longer let myself stay close
To the one thing that hurts me the most
I will not kiss the thorn
Hearts don't need to bleed to know what they're for
There'll be no more heartaches
There'll be no more heartaches for me

I take back my sweetness
It's overlooked by your lust
My song is unseen
cause your touch is too tough
I don't think your hands know how to adore
The subtlety of me anymore
I unfasten myself from your side
Slip away, quiet as a sigh
There'll be no more heartaches
There'll be no more heartaches for me

Beds filled with suspicion
Hearts filled with spite
We sleep with thieves
And forego our sights
Too quick to hold
someone's word over our own
You may be cool
You may know how to flatter
In the end (all I have is matter (?))
There'll be no more heartaches
There'll be no more heartaches
No more heartache anymore
anymore, oh oh oh, for me.
</pre>
