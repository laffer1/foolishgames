<h1>Summer Home In Your Arms</h1>
<pre>
You take your coat off and throw it on the floor
Night has built you into my arms once more
You feel so familiar as you get into bed
Cigarette smoke halo around you head
You lean over and kiss me so sweet...
I could lay with you like this for hours...
Hours and hours
Building a summer home in your arms
I kiss you with the languid adiration of slumber
Landin' random as lotto numbers
One for each eye
And, oops, one on your nose
And ten for each of your cute little toes
You lean over and kiss me so sweet...
I could lay with you like this for hours...
Hours and hours...
Building a summer home in your arms
Am I crazy, do I talk too much?
Sometimes I think your silence is a crutch
Am I mad, are you married?
Oh jesus this love stuff can sure be scary
But so sweet... So sweet
Here in your arms
I'm a bit of a mess and I'm gone too much
But when I'm away it's you I long to touch
And certain things remind me it's such a special treat
As these little things that bring you to me
You lean over and kiss me so sweet...
I could lay with you like this for hours...
Hours and hours...
Building a summer home in your arms
I'm building a summer home in your arms
I'm building a summer home in your arms
I'm building a summer home in your arms
Built with all your charms
