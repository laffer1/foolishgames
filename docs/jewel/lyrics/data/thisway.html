 <h1>This Way (this way version)</h1>

<pre>Love be still
Love be sweet
Don't you dare
Change a thing
I want to photograph you with my mind
To feel how I feel now all the time

CHORUS
Say that you'll stay
Forever this way
Forever and forever
That we'll never have to change
Don't move
Don't breathe
Don't change
Don't leave
And promise me
Say you'll stay
We'll stay
This way

I get afraid
Don't think ahead
Let's just stay
This way in bed
Feels so good inside your arms
Home is everywhere that you are

CHORUS

Don't move
Don't breathe
Don't change
Don't leave
Promise me
We'll always be
This kind, this sweet
This good to me
Promise me
You'll always be

CHORUS</pre>
