<h1>Absense of Fear</h1>
<pre>
inside my skin there is this space 
it twists and turns 
it bleeds and aches 
inside my heart there's an empty room 
it's waiting for lightning 
it's waiting for you 
and i am wanting 
and i am needing you here 
inside the absence of fear

muscle and sinew 
velvet and stone 
this vessel is haunted 
it creaks and moans 
my bones call to you 
in their separate skin 
i make myself translucent 
to let you in, for i am wanting 
and i am needing you here 
inside the absence of fear

there is this hunger 
this restlessness inside of me 
and it knows that you're no stranger 
you're my gravity 
my hands will adore you through all darkness aim 
they will lay you out in moonlight 
and reinvent your name 
for i am wanting you 
and i am needing you here 
i need you near 
inside the absence of fear
</pre>
