<h1>Standing Still</h1>
<pre>

        Transcribed by Brett (PENNY16161@aol.com)

Cutting through the darkest night with my two head lights 
Trying to keep it clear, but I'm losing it here, to the twilight 
There's a dead end to my left, there's a burning bush to my right 
You aren't in sight, you aren't in sight 

Do you want me 
Like I want you 

Or am I standing still 
Beneath the darkened sky 
Or am I standing still 
With the scenery flying by 
Or am I standing still 
Out of the corner of my eye 
Was that you 
Passing my by 

Mother's on the stoop, boys in souped up coupes, on this hot summer night 
Between fight and flight is the blind man's sight and a choice that's right 
I roll the window down, feel like I'm, I'm gonna drown, in this strange town 
Feel broken down, I feel broken down 

Do you need me 
Like I need you 

Or am I standing still 
Beneath the darkened sky 
Or am I standing still 
With the scenery flying by 
Or am I standing still 
Out of the corner of my eye 
Was that you 
Passing my by 

Sweet sorrow - He said call tomorrow
Sweet sorrow - He said call tomorrow

Do you love me 
Like I love you 

Or am I standing still 
Beneath the darkened sky 
Or am I standing still 
With the scenery flying by 
Or am I standing still 
Out of the corner of my eye 
Was that you 
Passing me by 

Are you passing me by 
Passing me by 
Do you want me 
Passing me by 

Do you need me 
Like I need you too 
And do you want me 
Like I want you 
(Passing me by) 

Are you passing me by 
Or am I standing still
