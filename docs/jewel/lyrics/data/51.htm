<h1>Angel Needs A Ride</h1>
<pre>
Said, "Angel, Do you want a ride?"
Said, "Angel, I'm tired and I'm lonely
And I need somebody by my side"

It's a long road that stretched from Vegas to nowhere
But it'd been an even longer time
Since he found some piece of mind
And he lived off of bubblegum and cigarettes
And got his nourishment from all-night stores
Thought he'd just keep driving
Til he outdrove his sorrow

He said, "Angel, Oh do you want a ride?"
Said "Angel, I'm tired and I'm lonely
And I need somebody by my side"

Her feet were warm and tired
But as determined as a soul
She left with no regrets
But also no posessions did she own
Her heart was as fragile as her thin, loving arms
She's praying to god to take away her lonely
When he pulled on aside of the road

And he said, "Angel, Oh do you want a ride?"
Said, "Angel, I'm tired and I'm lonely
And I need somebody by my side"

The highway goes on forever
I've seen a thousand men like him before
And I've seen a thousand angels that
Got into the car
They're just a couple of lost souls
Looking to rekindle some sort of forgotten dream
I hope they find what they're looking for
In the solace of the road

They said, "Angel, Do you want a ride?"
Said, "Angel, I'm tired and I'm lonely
I'm tired and I'm lonely
I'm tired and I'm lonely
I'm tired and I'm lonely
And I need to have somebody
By my angel"
