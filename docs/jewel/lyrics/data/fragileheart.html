<h1>Fragile Heart</h1>
<pre>
If u want my heart
U have 2 promise not 2 tear it apart
'Cause my heart
Has been hurt a lot
And it always seems
Love is not sweet, like in dreams
Something falls through
But I don't want that 2 happen 2 me and u

CHORUS

So be
Careful, warning
Fragile heart

Last Saturday
We ate dinner at your parents' place
Last Saturday, u said
How u feel will not go away
Well, all the fishes in the sea
Could not be happier than me

CHORUS

Only fools believe that
Nothing changes, nothing leaves
But I need 2 believe that we at least
Will have some dignity
'Cause everything changes
Nothing stays the same
But that's no excuse 2 be casual
Or 2 place the blame
U have 2 be careful with me

CHORUS
</pre>
