<h1>Silver Lining</h1>
<pre>
Transcribed by Tom Proven

My muffins are in the toaster
I got my raspberry jam
My grandfather was a sailor
that came onto this land
and he was looking for gold,
a pretty hand to hold,
or some cards to fold.
At least, that's what I was told.

Silver Lining
Silver Lining, where do you go?

Turn on my TV
They got talking heads in space
used to be so easy
to have a little faith
I used to rely on luck
I didn't feel so stuck
Could earn an honest buck
without lookin round, like Jon Kruk.

Silver Lining
Silver Lining, where do you go?

I used to have hope
Now we got soap on a rope
I used to have dreams
Now we got overplayed baseball teams
We got grocery baggers, grafitti taggers,
golf-ball shaggers, go team go.

Silver Lining
Silver Lining, where do you go?

My landlord knocks upon my door
He's got that payday face
I swear to God he should be payin me
To live inside this place
It's filled with sharks and fins
whose double chins say
Thicken your skin, child
if you want to win

Silver Lining
Silver Lining, where do you go?

I fix myself some herbal tea
cause it's healthier they say
well, healthier ain't half as fun
I take a cold beer anyday
I used to have dysfunctional fun
in the cancerous sun
with my co-dependent hon
eatin greasy greasy hotdogs on a buttered up bun

Silver Lining
Silver Lining, where do you go?
Silver Lining
Silver Lining, where do you go?

[scat solo]

Repeat refrain. (x2)
