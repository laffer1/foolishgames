<h2>High School Pictures</h2>
<p>Click on an image to see a larger version.</p>
<p>These photographs were taken at Interlochen Arts Academy in Interlochen, MI. 
</p>
<p> The third image was taken in the Fine Arts Building. It was also suggested 
  that it was taken during a Coffee House performance. Coffee House performances 
  happen once a month during the school year, and feature students who perform 
  in the order in which they sign up. No one but the person performing is aware 
  of the content. Typically staff members do not participate, so practically anything 
  can be performed without fear of disciplinary action. Thanks to Erinn for this 
  information.</p>
