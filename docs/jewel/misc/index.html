    <h3><a name="bits">Meaningless Bits 'n Pieces From Me</a></h3>
    <p>I went to see my first Jewel concert September 5th, 1997 at Meadow Brook. 
        (Rochester Hills, MI)&nbsp; I loved the concert. Jewel played part of 
        the concert by herself, and then brought out a band for the latter half 
        of the concert. The opening act was not very good though. The guy was 
        practically boo'd off the stage. Jewel came out during his performance 
        and told us to stop as it was her friend. The crowd was really upset because 
        the concert was supposed to start at 8PM EST and it was almost 8:45PM, 
        and the opening act was still on. Jewel played between 9PM and 9:45PM. 
        She performed mostly tracks off of POY, with a few &quot; new &quot; tracks. 
        Jewel refused to sign autographs or talk to anyone after the concert. 
        Many of us thought it was because the crowd upset her. Someone proposed 
        marriage during the concert to Jewel by yelling from the cheap lawn seats. 
        He was a bit intoxicated. She told him to &quot;shut up and sit down because 
        no one would want to marry you.&quot; He did just that. I went to the 
        concert with a friend, Michelle. She did not care to much for the concert. 
        At the time she told me she had a good time, but I found out later she 
        was humoring me. Go figure. Jewel also told a short antedote about a high 
        school she played in the Detroit area in the past. She said that the students 
        thought she was Jewell, a rap group. She quickly was boo'd off stage. 
        After the concert, several young girls were singing &quot;Pieces of You&quot; 
        at the top of their lungs in the parking lot. Some stayed for the second 
        &quot;concert.&quot; My biggest complaint about the concert was that there 
        were not any good t-shirts to purchase. Just two days later I went on 
        my first date with my wife Caryn. I guess you could say that was a really 
        good weekend for me.</p>
