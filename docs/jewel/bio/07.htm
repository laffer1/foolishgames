<h2>Ride With The Devil</h2>
<p>Ride With The Devil is a civil war drama in which Jewel plays a love interest 
    for two soldiers. In the movie, one of the soldiers dies, leaving Sue Lee 
    Shelly (Jewel) pregnant, and alone. The other soldier, refered to as &quot;Deutch,&quot; 
    is roped into a relationship with Sue Lee Shelly, and her child. </p>
<p>Ride With The Devil was filmed near Kansas City, Missouri between March 1998, 
    and July 1998. It's based on the novel &quot;Woe to Live On&quot; by David 
    Woodrell. The movie was directed by Ang Lee. Not surprisingly, the movie started 
    out at Fox and ended up at Universal Pictures. At one point, the budget for 
    the film was estimated at $35 million.</p>
<p>The film went through several name changes during the course of filming including 
    &quot;To Live On&quot;, &quot;Dance With The Devil,&quot; and of course the 
    final title &quot;Ride With The Devil.&quot; Many EDAs refer to the film in 
    conversation as RWTD.</p>
<p>Ride With The Devil was released on DVD, and VHS format in several regions. 
    More information is available on the news page in June 2000. The film also 
    is shown on the Starz Network from time to time.</p>
