<h2>Chapter 1: The Beginning</h2>
<h3>Jewel is Born</h3>
<p>  Jewel Kilcher was born May 23rd, 1974 in Payson, Utah<sup>1</sup>. She grew up in
  Anchorage, Alaska, surrounded by several relatives and beautiful countryside.
  Ms. Kilcher
    has an older brother named Shane, and a younger brother named Atz Jr. An
    older brother, named Vance, died at the age of nine months from an illness.
    She also has a half brother by the name of Nikos. Jewel had her mother teach
    school at home during her early years. Jewel found out later that she was
    dyslexic.<br>
</p>
<p>Jewel's parents were a singer/songwriter duo that toured together around
    the state. Jewel started touring with her father Atz and mother Lenedra around
    age
six, singing folk music in bars and clubs throughout Alaska. Most of the audience
consisted of tourists and the occasional Eskimo from the local village. She soon
picked up yodeling, a talent that had been passed down from her grandfather.
Soon, Jewel's yodeling became a regular part of the show.</p>
<h3>  The Divorce</h3>
<p>  <a href="0018.jpg"><img src="0018_small.jpg" alt="Young Jewel" border="0" height="142" width="100" align="left" /></a>Jewel&#8217;s parents divorced in 1982. Although their marriage did not work,
both still have a place in their hearts for Jewel. For the most part, she lived
with her father in Homer, Alaska until age seventeen. Her home was located on
an 800-acre plot of land. Utilities including water and electricity were non-existent.
There was an outhouse on the property in place of a bathroom. She also worked
around the house with chores that included haying, tending horses, and working
in the garden. Jewel did continue to tour with her father off and on for seven
years after the divorce.</p>
<p>  During a brief period around age twelve, she lived with her aunt in Hawaii.
    She did not fit in well at first. Eventually she won hearts over with her
    Yodeling
talent. The children found it fascinating and overlooked the difference in her
skin color and mannerisms. </p>
<p>  During the period following the divorce, Lenedra continued to teach her about
art, music, and poetry. She began to write poetry. This new form of expression
helped Jewel cope with her emotions and challenges that life had thrown her way.</p>
<p>  Later, as Jewel grew up, she found other methods of travel, including hitchhiking.
Once someone questioned her about this, and Jewel's reply was pulling out a knife
and saying &quot;would you f_ with me?&quot; The lady was shocked to see such
behavior out of a fifteen year old. That's Jewel for you.</p>
<p>Continue on to Chapter 2: <a href="02.htm">High School</a></p>
<p> <sup>1</sup>Some sites have posted that Jewel was born at Payson Hospital
  in St. George, Utah. Research has shown that St. George has a hospital named
  Dixie Regional
  Medical Center and not Payson Hospital. The only evidence that points to St.
  George is a post on a Jewel mailing list by Mr. BB. Most other sources including
the official Jewel website point to Payson, Utah as the correct birth place.</p>
