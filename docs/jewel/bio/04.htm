<h2>Chapter 4: Transition</h2>
<h3>You Were Meant for Me Music Video</h3>
<p>&#8220;You Were Meant for Me&#8221; was originally shot with her then boyfriend
  Sean Penn as the director. This version had more of a country/western feel
  to it.
    The video was shot again at Jewel's request with Steve Poltz, CO-Writer.
  Other versions of the video exist, including a VH1 version.</p>
<h3> Other Events</h3>
<p>  Jewel was #1 for 5 weeks on Casey's Top 40 and fell to #4 below Hanson, the
  Wallflowers, and Savage Garden (YWMFM).</p>
<p>  Jewel had a star named after her &quot;Jewel of the North&quot; for her
  birthday 1997 from several of the Every Day Angel's.<sup>2</sup> </p>
<p>  In 1997, the Innerchange was demolished. A few other losses of that year
    include the death of Jewel's Grandmother, Ruth Kilcher Marriot (she was remarried),
    and the death of Clearwater (Jewel's horse).<br>
&#8220;
  Pieces of You&#8221; was released on Compact Disc, Cassette, and Vinyl. The
    Vinyl version includes four tracks there were not part of the original release
in the United States.</p>
<p>Foolish Games made it several months in the top twenty. The video for Foolish
    Games included several scenes where Jewel was dancing with herself... actually
  those scenes includes Jewel and a look alike. There was no splicing done.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> The information on &#8220;Jewel of the North&#8221; was kept
  on a fan website called &#8220;Pieces of Jewel.&#8221; Unfortunately, this
  site was removed
from the Internet in 2002. </p>
