    I am surrounded by a life of accomplishment,fame, <br>
    and I see the many people who I touched throughout the world. </font></p><font face="Garamond">
    <p>This is not at all the way I thought it would be. <br>
    When I was a young girl, I thought I would <br>
    be a simple person, in a simple town, living a simple life. </p>
    <p>But no, that is not what happened. </p>
    <p>Is it good my life took this trail of young glory? <br>
    I really am not sure. <br>
    Would I be happier now if I could have took that other way of being alive? </p>
    <p>I ask you this my friend, but indeed I do tell you. <br>
    I figure this is the way things are suppose to be, <br>
    God had allowed it to be so. <br>
    So now I look around and accept the path I am on, <br>
    and I continue to reach for that bright shining star hidden behind the sun.</font> </td>
